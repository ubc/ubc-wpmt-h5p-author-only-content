# UBC WPMT H5P Author Only Content

By default, H5P allows users with the Author role to see H5P content made by author authors.

For author roles, this plugin restricts the H5P content listing in the dashboard to only the currently signed in user.

# ToDo

On deactivation of the plugin, set the role back to the way it was and delete the option.
